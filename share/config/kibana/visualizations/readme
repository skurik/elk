To create a visualization, run:

	curl -XPOST 'http://<elasticsearch_host>:9200/.kibana/visualization/<id>' --data "@<path>"

Where
	<elasticsearch_host> is the hostname or IP address of the machine where ES is running
	<id> is the ID of the new visualization
	<path> is a path of one of the files in this folder

IMPORTANT: The metrics visualization, as of now, consider data from all machines.
We will of course need to create visualization per machine (or possibly plot multiple machines in the same graph)
